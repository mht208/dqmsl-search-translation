# DQMSL Search Translation

This project provides a userscript that translates Japanese names in DQMSL
Search (http://dqmsl-search.net) to Chinese.

## Installation

For Google Chrome, an extension is available on
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dqmsl-search-translation/bfoalanjlafmpdifnnohngjdlbhkephh?hl=en-GB).
